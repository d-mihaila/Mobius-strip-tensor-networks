# Mobius-strip-tensor-networks

This code is computing the Hamiltonian of a superconducting Mobius strip. Using a DMRG algorithm via the pytenet library we calculate the minimum energies for variouse circuit sizes. 
Our goal is to analize the coherence properties of the 0-Ï€ qubit as it aproaces near degenerate ground state. 

This research is based on the article 'Spectrum and coherence properties of the current-mirror qubit' and we used the quantum tensor network library by Professor Christian Mendl cmendl/pytenet as referenced below.
